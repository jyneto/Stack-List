<h1>Stack and List Generic Collection </h1>

<p>Assignment that involves creating and managing a collection of Employee objects using two common generic types in C#: Stack and List. 

The task is divided into two parts:

<h3>Part 1 – Stack</h3>
<h5>Create a Class:</h5>

Define a class named Employee with properties: Id, Name, Gender, and Salary.

<h5>Create Stack with Objects: </h5>

In the Main() method, create five Employee objects with different Ids, Names, Genders, and Salaries.

Add these objects to a Stack using the Push() method.

<h5>Print All Objects:</h5>

Use a foreach loop to print each Employee in the stack.

After printing each Employee, display the count of remaining objects in the stack.

Retrieve All Objects Using Pop:

Use the Pop() method to retrieve and print each Employee until the stack is empty.

After printing each Employee, display the count of remaining objects in the stack.

Re-add all objects to the stack using the Push() method.

Retrieve Objects Using Peek:

Use the Peek() method to retrieve and print the top two Employee objects.

After peeking, display the count of remaining objects in the stack.

Check for Specific Object:

Check if the third Employee exists in the stack and print the result.


<h3>Part 2 – List</h3>

<h5>Create a List</h5>

Add five objects of the Employee class to your list.

Create a condition using the Contains() method to check if a specific object exists in the list. If it does, print "Employee2 object exists in the list" in the console. Otherwise, print "Employee2 object does not exist in the list". </p>

Then use the Find() method to find and print the first object in the list that has Gender = "Male".

Then use the FindAll() method to find and print all objects in the list that have Gender = "Male".
