#Stack and List Generic Collection

Assignment that involves creating and managing a collection of Employee objects using two common generic types in C#: Stack and List. 

The task is divided into two parts:

Part 1 – Stack
Create a Class:

Define a class named Employee with properties: Id, Name, Gender, and Salary.

Create Stack with Objects:

In the Main() method, create five Employee objects with different Ids, Names, Genders, and Salaries.

Add these objects to a Stack using the Push() method.

Print All Objects:

Use a foreach loop to print each Employee in the stack.

After printing each Employee, display the count of remaining objects in the stack.

Retrieve All Objects Using Pop:

Use the Pop() method to retrieve and print each Employee until the stack is empty.

After printing each Employee, display the count of remaining objects in the stack.

Re-add all objects to the stack using the Push() method.

Retrieve Objects Using Peek:

Use the Peek() method to retrieve and print the top two Employee objects.

After peeking, display the count of remaining objects in the stack.

Check for Specific Object:

Check if the third Employee exists in the stack and print the result.


Part 2 – List

Create a List.

Add five objects of the Employee class to your list.

Create a condition using the Contains() method to check if a specific object exists in the list. If it does, print "Employee2 object exists in the list" in the console. Otherwise, print "Employee2 object does not exist in the list".

Then use the Find() method to find and print the first object in the list that has Gender = "Male".

Then use the FindAll() method to find and print all objects in the list that have Gender = "Male".
